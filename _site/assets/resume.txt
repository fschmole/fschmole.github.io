PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY
* Silicon SoC, IP, and I/O Architect with 25+ years of experience specializing in High-Performance Interconnects (PCIe/CXL/UXI), Coherency, and Scalability.
* Expert in de-risking complex silicon through First-Principles modeling and data-driven verification.
* Architect with 15 patent filings focused on interconnects and coherency, bringing a track record of driving multi-generational performance and power optimizations for server-class SoCs.
* Collaborative technical leader who builds high-trust engineering cultures and is known for mentoring engineers by fostering ownership and architectural rigor.
KEY TECHNICAL WINS & INNOVATION
* GPU Interconnect Optimization: Led architectural discovery and firmware prototyping for PCIe P2P Ordering enhancements. Identified and resolved a critical destination-change stall, facilitating a ~2000% gain in nvbandwidth benchmarks for multi-agent GPU clusters while maintaining same-address ordering.
* Mesh Architecture Efficiency: Optimized mesh topology and protocol, successfully reducing power consumption and alleviating mesh oversubscription.
* Strategic Scalability (Intel® VMD): Re-architected the legacy Volume Management Device into the Virtual Meta Device, a strategic competitive advantage that solves device aggregation challenges for server platforms, enabling scalable storage and networking virtualization.
* Innovation Velocity: Author of 15 USPTO Patent Filings and 27 Invention Disclosures, focusing on interconnects, coherency, and virtualization.
* Silicon Quality: Established a “Correct-by-Construction” architectural culture by developing and evangelizing formal Code-to-Spec workflows and by analyzing >72 real-world PCIe traces to simulate bandwidth improvements, confirm protocol assumptions, and proactively mitigate design risks before RTL execution.

PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE
INTEL CORPORATION | Hillsboro, OR | Sep 2000 – Present
SoC, IP & I/O Architect | Aug 2013 – Present
* Architecture & Design Strategy: Led the end-to-end definition of high-bandwidth I/O fabrics (PCIe Gen6/7, UXI, CXL) for next-generation server SoCs. Transformed abstract requirements into rigorous, code-based specifications to ensure "correct-by-construction" silicon.
* Scalability & Virtualization: Re-architected the Intel® VMD subsystem into a Virtual Meta Device to support next-generation device aggregation, directly addressing the industry need for scalable, virtualized I/O in rack-scale AI and data center environments.
* Technical Execution: Architected Same-Destination and Same-Address Ordering solutions by analyzing open-source GPU driver behavior and reverse-engineering data movement constraints, bridging the gap between NVLink ordering models and standard PCIe deployments.
* Methodology Leadership: Transitioned the organization from static document-based specs to dynamic, machine-readable “Code-as-Spec” workflows (XML/YAML/JSON, plantUML, PlusCal/TLA+), significantly reducing interpretation errors between Architecture and Design/Validation teams, and drastically improving quality of AI-augmented implementations via Spec-to-Prompt precision.
* Mentorship & Team Growth: Built a collaborative, high-trust engineering environment, focused on technical excellence and integrity, successfully mentoring four engineers to the Principal rank and demonstrating a core commitment to sustained team growth and ownership.
* Cross-Functional Alignment: Facilitated structured architectural reviews across Design, Verification, and Firmware teams to resolve complex trade-offs in power, performance, and area (PPA).
Verification Manager & Technical Lead | Jan 2009 – July 2013
* Directed the verification of the PCIe interface block, leading a geographically distributed team to high-confidence delivery of complex designs.
Component Design Engineer | Sep 2000 – Jan 2009
* Diverse roles in network processor validation, Ethernet controller verification, and server I/O chipsets. 
* Rotations in technical marketing/evangelism and Ethernet NIC board design.
