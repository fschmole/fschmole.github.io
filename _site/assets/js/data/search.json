What to expect Architecture &amp; Microarchitecture Trade-off analyses, pipeline design notes, memory system explorations, and write-ups on topics like coherence protocols and on-chip interconnects. RTL &amp; Implementation Notes on synthesis flows, timing constraints, and the gap between architectural intent and physical reality. Performance Engineering Workload characterization, bottleneck hunting, and the cycle-accurate models that reveal what is actually happening inside a chip. Tools &amp; Scripts Python utilities and browser-based tools from the python-scripts and web-apps directories — automation that makes EDA work faster. Stay tuned for more posts." } ]
