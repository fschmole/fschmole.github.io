# About

I'm a **silicon hardware architect** with deep expertise in the full stack of
digital design — from high-level microarchitecture and ISA definition down to
RTL implementation, synthesis constraints, timing closure, and silicon bring-up.

## Focus Areas

| Domain | Details |
|---|---|
| **Microarchitecture** | Pipelines, out-of-order execution, branch prediction, speculative execution |
| **Memory Systems** | Cache hierarchies, coherence protocols (MESI/MOESI), DRAM/HBM interfaces |
| **On-chip Interconnects** | NoC topology, flow control, QoS, cache-coherent fabric |
| **Performance Analysis** | Cycle-accurate simulation, workload characterization, bottleneck analysis |
| **RTL & Synthesis** | SystemVerilog RTL, synthesis flows, timing constraints (SDC), physical signoff |
| **Verification** | Formal property verification, UVM environments, micro-architectural corner cases |
| **Tools & Automation** | Python-based EDA tooling, post-silicon debug scripts, coverage analysis |

## About This Site

Posts here cover architecture trade-offs, implementation notes, and the Python
and browser-based tools I build to make hardware work faster and easier to
understand. Everything is written for an audience of engineers who work in or
adjacent to silicon design.
