Welcome to **schmole.com** — a space for engineering notes, deep dives, and
tools from my work in silicon hardware architecture.

Posts here will cover fabric architecture trade-offs, formal specification
workflows, data-driven trace analysis, and the Python and browser-based
utilities I build to make hardware design faster and more rigorous.
