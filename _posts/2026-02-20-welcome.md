Welcome to **schmole.com** — a public space for engineering notes, deep dives,
and the tools I build while working in silicon hardware architecture.

## What to expect

**Architecture & Microarchitecture**
: Trade-off analyses, pipeline design notes, memory system explorations, and
  write-ups on topics like coherence protocols and on-chip interconnects.

**RTL & Implementation**
: Notes on synthesis flows, timing constraints, and the gap between
  architectural intent and physical reality.

**Performance Engineering**
: Workload characterization, bottleneck hunting, and the cycle-accurate models
  that reveal what is actually happening inside a chip.

**Tools & Scripts**
: Python utilities and browser-based tools from the
  [python-scripts](https://github.com/fschmole/public/tree/main/python-scripts)
  and [web-apps](https://github.com/fschmole/public/tree/main/web-apps)
  directories — automation that makes EDA work faster.

Stay tuned for more posts.
